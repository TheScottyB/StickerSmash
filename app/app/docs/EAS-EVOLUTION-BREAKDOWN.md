# EAS Evolution: From Commands to Workflows

## The Fragmented Era (EAS v1-2)

In the early days of EAS, deployment was largely a collection of individual commands:

```bash
# Individual steps with manual orchestration
eas build   # Just build
eas submit  # Just submit
eas update  # Just update
```

Developers had to:
- Manually chain these commands together
- Handle failures and retries themselves
- Create their own scripts for automation
- Manage credential passing between steps
- Navigate complex configuration files
- Maintain separate CI configurations

This fragmented approach worked but required considerable expertise and custom scripting.

## The Workflow Revolution (EAS v3)

EAS Workflows introduced a cohesive orchestration layer on top of the individual services:

```yaml
# Unified declarative workflow
steps:
  - uses: checkout
  - uses: eas-build
  - uses: eas-submit
  - uses: eas-metadata-push
```

Key advances:
- **Declarative definition** of entire deployment pipeline
- **Built-in orchestration** with proper error handling
- **Standardized environment** for all steps
- **Output passing** between workflow steps
- **Reusable workflows** for different deployment scenarios
- **Integrated scheduling** and triggers

## The Split Path: Cloud vs. Local

A significant decision point emerged in the evolution:

### Cloud-Based Path
- Full EAS services in the cloud
- Managed infrastructure for builds
- Integrated with Expo dashboard
- Higher performance on cloud machines
- No local iOS toolchain needed

### Local Build Path
- `eas build --local` option introduced
- Use local machine for building
- Utilize EAS for orchestration only
- More control over build environment
- Useful for specialized requirements

## The Services Unification (Latest)

The latest evolution brings complete unification:

1. **App Store Connect API Integration**
   - Unified credential management across services
   - Automatic provisioning profile generation
   - Certificate lifecycle management
   - App metadata synchronization

2. **GitHub Integration**
   - Workflows triggered by repository events
   - Code and configuration in same repository
   - PR-based workflow triggers
   - Branch-specific build configurations

3. **Metadata Services**
   - Store listing management in code
   - Validation before submission
   - Asset synchronization
   - Release notes automation

## Navigation Complexity

The EAS ecosystem has become tremendously powerful but introduces decision complexity:

### Decision Points
- Cloud build vs. Local build
- CLI workflow vs. Dashboard workflow
- Manual vs. GitHub-triggered builds
- Individual services vs. Workflow orchestration
- Self-managed credentials vs. API key credentials

### Configuration Files
- `app.json` - Basic app configuration
- `eas.json` - Build profiles and service settings
- `eas-workflows.yml` - Workflow definitions
- `store.config.json` - App store metadata

## Optimal Path for Most Teams

For teams without specialized requirements, the optimal path has emerged:

1. Use GitHub integration with EAS
2. Use App Store Connect API for credentials
3. Define workflows in `eas-workflows.yml`
4. Manage metadata in `store.config.json`
5. Let EAS handle all orchestration
6. Trigger workflows via dashboard or CI

This approach minimizes configuration complexity while maximizing automation and reliability, representing the culmination of EAS's evolution from a collection of commands to a comprehensive deployment platform.
