# StickerSmash Deployment Options

This document outlines the different approaches to deploying the StickerSmash app to iOS, focusing on the available Expo deployment methods from oldest to newest.

## Approach 1: EAS CLI (Command Line Interface)

Using the CLI approach is typically straightforward for new projects and standard environments.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Login to your Expo account
npx eas-cli@latest login

# Initialize EAS for your project
npx eas-cli@latest init

# Configure the build settings
npx eas-cli@latest build:configure

# Start an iOS development build
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform ios --profile development
```

### When to Use CLI Approach

✅ Interactive terminal environments
✅ New Expo accounts or projects
✅ When you prefer command-line tools
✅ Simple project structures

### Potential Limitations

❌ Non-interactive environments (CI systems, some cloud environments)
❌ Accounts with historical configurations (10+ years)
❌ Complex project structures requiring multiple build profiles
❌ When detailed error reporting is needed

### Testing the CLI Approach

We've provided a script to test whether the CLI approach works in your environment:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x retry-cli-approach.sh

# Run the script
./retry-cli-approach.sh
```

## Approach 2: EAS Hub (Web Dashboard Interface)

The Hub approach leverages the Expo web dashboard and workflow configurations.

### Basic Process

1. Log in to [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)
2. Create or select your project
3. **CRITICAL:** Manually connect your GitHub repository
   - This step CANNOT be automated
   - Install the Expo GitHub app to your account
   - Authorize access to your repository
4. Configure credentials
5. Set up workflows
6. Trigger builds through the dashboard

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The GitHub repository connection is mandatory and must be done manually through the web interface. EAS Workflows will not function without this connection.

### When to Use Hub Approach

✅ Non-interactive environments
✅ Accounts with historical configurations
✅ Projects requiring detailed workflow automation
✅ When team collaboration features are needed
✅ CI/CD integration requirements

### Potential Limitations

❌ Requires internet access to use dashboard
❌ May have slight learning curve for command-line purists
❌ Some advanced customizations may still require CLI for specific tasks

### Testing the Hub Approach

We've provided resources to help you transition to the Hub approach:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x transition-to-hub.sh

# Run the transition helper
./transition-to-hub.sh
```

## Approach 4: Dashboard-First Approach

This hybrid approach starts with the Expo dashboard rather than the CLI.

### Basic Process

1. Go to [expo.dev](https://expo.dev) and click "Create a project"
2. Configure your project through the web interface
3. Copy the assigned project ID to your app.json file
4. Run `npx eas-cli@latest init --non-interactive` to connect your local project
5. Continue with builds using either CLI or workflows

### When to Use Dashboard-First Approach

✅ For accounts with historical configurations
✅ When encountering ID validation issues with CLI approach
✅ If you prefer visual configuration before CLI usage
✅ For simpler project setup with fewer potential errors

## Approach 5: Expo Orbit (Newest Method)

Expo Orbit represents the latest evolution in Expo's deployment tools, offering a streamlined experience.

### Key Features

- One-click build and update launches
- Integrated simulator management
- Simplified workflow with visual interface
- Faster development cycles

### When to Use Expo Orbit

✅ For the most modern deployment experience
✅ When speed of iteration is critical
✅ To reduce command-line complexity
✅ For beginners or teams wanting simplified workflows

## Deciding Between Approaches

1. **For Maximum Automation**: Use Expo Orbit (newest approach)
2. **For Account Compatibility**: Try Dashboard-First method if you have historical account configurations
3. **For Non-Interactive Environments**: Use CLI with `--non-interactive --force` flags
4. **For Team Workflows**: Use the Hub approach with Workflows
5. **For Complete Control**: Use standard CLI approach

## Research Findings Summary

Our research has revealed several key insights:

1. **CLI Approach**
   - Works well with `--non-interactive --force` flags for automation
   - May encounter issues with historical account configurations

2. **Hub Approach**
   - Requires manual GitHub connection
   - Provides better visibility and team features
   - More robust workflow capabilities

3. **Dashboard-First Hybrid**
   - May prevent ID validation issues
   - Good for historical account configurations
   - Combines dashboard creation with CLI connection

4. **Expo Orbit (Newest)**
   - Represents the latest generation of deployment tools
   - Designed for simplicity and speed
   - Integrates build, update, and simulator management

## Our Research Context

This is part of a broader research initiative comparing different "eras" of iOS app deployment. Your experiences and documentation contribute valuable insights into how modern deployment tools handle different account configurations and project complexities.
