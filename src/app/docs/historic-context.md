The Evolution of Expo's Build and Deployment Services: The Advent of Expo Application ServicesThe landscape of cross-platform mobile application development has been significantly shaped by the emergence of frameworks like React Native, which enable developers to build applications for both Android and iOS using a single codebase. Expo, built upon React Native, has further simplified this process by providing a comprehensive suite of tools, libraries, and services designed to streamline development, testing, and deployment.1 A pivotal moment in Expo's evolution was the introduction of Expo Application Services (EAS), a collection of cloud services that marked a substantial advancement in how Expo and React Native developers approach the crucial stages of building and deploying their applications.1 This report aims to provide a historical account of Expo's build and deployment services, tracing their development from the initial offerings to the introduction and impact of EAS.Prior to the advent of EAS, developers utilizing the Expo framework relied on a set of tools and processes that, while innovative for their time, presented certain limitations. The primary method for generating standalone application binaries was the expo build command.3 This command initiated a process where the developer's project was uploaded to Expo's cloud infrastructure. Expo's build servers would then compile the native iOS and Android application binaries, resulting in the familiar.apk and.ipa files.1 This cloud-based build process abstracted away much of the complexity associated with setting up and managing native development environments like Xcode and Android Studio, allowing developers to concentrate primarily on their JavaScript code.2Once the build process was completed, developers were responsible for downloading these binary files and manually submitting them to the respective app stores â€“ Apple's App Store Connect and Google's Play Console.1 This step necessitated that developers possess the necessary developer accounts and manage their application signing credentials, particularly the provisioning profiles and certificates required by iOS.1 This manual submission process could be time-consuming and often required a detailed understanding of the specific requirements and procedures of each app store.In the development phase, Expo Go played a crucial role.2 This native application, available on both Android and iOS, allowed developers to rapidly prototype and test their applications on physical devices by simply scanning a QR code.2 Expo Go provided access to a wide array of device functionalities through the Expo SDK, enabling developers to implement complex features without delving into native code.2 However, Expo Go operated within a predefined set of native modules included in the Expo SDK. A significant limitation arose when developers needed to incorporate custom native modules or functionalities not available within this curated set.6To overcome this limitation, developers initially had to resort to a process known as "ejecting" their Expo project.1 Ejecting essentially detached the project from the managed Expo environment, providing the developer with the underlying native iOS (Xcode) and Android (Android Studio) projects.1 This granted the freedom to add custom native code and directly modify the native project configurations. However, this came at the cost of losing the benefits of the managed Expo workflow, such as the ease of over-the-air updates and the simplified build process offered by the Expo CLI.9 Recognizing the drawbacks of this approach, Expo later introduced the npx expo prebuild command in SDK 41 (April 2021), which offered a more integrated way to generate native projects based on the project's configuration and dependencies.1 This command effectively replaced the "eject" process, which was fully deprecated in SDK 46 (August 2022).The landscape of Expo development underwent a significant transformation with the introduction of Expo Application Services (EAS). The public preview of EAS Build and EAS Submit was announced on December 15, 2020 4, followed by the general availability of EAS on November 10, 2021.3 The primary motivation behind EAS was to provide a faster and more streamlined pathway for taking Expo applications from the development stage to the app stores.3 EAS aimed to address the limitations of the classic build service, particularly concerning the integration of custom native code, and to simplify the overall application lifecycle.3 It was designed to be versatile, catering to both managed and bare React Native projects.3The initial offering of EAS comprised two key services: EAS Build and EAS Submit.4 EAS Build represented a significant evolution of the original expo build service. A crucial enhancement was the support for custom native code.3 This breakthrough allowed developers to incorporate any compatible library from platforms like GitHub or npm, even if those libraries contained native dependencies, without the need to fully detach from the managed Expo workflow.4 This capability broadened the scope of applications that could be built with Expo while retaining the advantages of its streamlined development environment.9Furthermore, EAS Build introduced the concept of "Development clients".3 These are essentially cloud-built, debug versions of the application that include developer tools, providing a more robust environment for testing features like authentication and push notifications, which had limitations within Expo Go.7 EAS Build also simplified the process of sharing test builds through "internal distribution".3 This feature enabled developers to easily distribute preview versions of their applications to team members and testers using ad hoc provisioning for iOS and standard APK side-loading for Android.3 The service also aimed to streamline the often cumbersome management of application signing credentials for both iOS and Android by offering automatically managed credentials, thereby accelerating the setup process for distribution.3The second core service introduced with EAS was EAS Submit.4 This service dramatically simplified the process of submitting application binaries to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.3 Developers could now initiate the submission process with a single command (eas submit) from their terminal or within their continuous integration (CI) environment.3 This eliminated the necessity of using platform-specific tools like Xcode's Transporter or the Google Play Console for the initial upload of the application.9 This cloud-based submission approach reduced the number of dependencies that needed to be installed on the developer's local machine and allowed for submissions from any operating system to any app store.4 EAS Submit was also designed to guide developers through their initial submissions and to provide helpful feedback and reminders regarding common requirements, such as the inclusion of privacy policies.4Over time, the classic expo build service was phased out, with EAS becoming the recommended and primary method for building Expo applications.12 Developers were encouraged to migrate to EAS to take advantage of its enhanced feature set and improved capabilities.12 The introduction of npx expo prebuild served as an important step in this transition, providing a more integrated way for developers to incorporate native code and configurations into their projects before utilizing EAS Build.1 Following the initial launch of EAS Build and Submit, the EAS ecosystem continued to expand with the introduction of other crucial services. EAS Update provided a more seamless and integrated solution for delivering over-the-air updates to applications.1 Furthermore, EAS Workflows was introduced to enable developers to automate their entire continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, encompassing building, testing, submission, and updates.13 These additions further solidified EAS as a comprehensive platform for managing the complete mobile application lifecycle.22The introduction of EAS brought about a significant transformation in the typical Expo development lifecycle.Before EAS:
Development often commenced using Expo Go for rapid prototyping and initial testing.
Building standalone applications for more comprehensive testing or for release to app stores involved using the expo build command, a process with limited visibility into the underlying native compilation steps.
Integrating custom native code necessitated the potentially disruptive step of "ejecting" the project, which meant losing the benefits of the managed Expo workflow.
Submitting applications to app stores was a manual process requiring familiarity with platform-specific tools and procedures.
While over-the-air updates were available through expo publish, they were a separate concern from the build and submission process.
After EAS:
Developers can still leverage Expo Go for initial development, but they also have the option to directly create development builds using EAS Build, allowing for early and more accurate testing of features relying on native code.
EAS Build offers greater transparency and control over the build process, including robust support for custom native code without requiring a full "eject."
EAS Submit streamlines the often complex process of app store submission through a unified CLI command.
EAS Update provides a more integrated and efficient mechanism for deploying over-the-air updates.
EAS Workflows empowers developers to automate their entire CI/CD pipeline, leading to more consistent, efficient, and faster release cycles.
The advent of EAS has brought about notable improvements in the efficiency, flexibility, and automation of Expo application development. The time and effort required for building, testing, and deploying applications have been significantly reduced through features like managed credentials and single-command submissions, which have simplified previously intricate processes.4 EAS Build has provided greater flexibility by enabling the integration of custom native code while preserving the advantages of the managed workflow.3 The introduction of development builds has offered a more reliable and accurate environment for testing application features.6 Furthermore, EAS Workflows has empowered developers to automate their entire CI/CD pipeline, encompassing building, testing, submission, and updates, resulting in more consistent and accelerated release processes.13Table 1: Timeline of Key Expo Build and Deployment MilestonesMilestoneDate (Approximate)Release of React NativeMarch 2015Initial release of ExpoNovember 2015Introduction of expo buildEarly Expo EraIntroduction of npx expo prebuild (SDK 41)April 2021Public preview of EAS Build and SubmitDecember 15, 2020General availability of EASNovember 10, 2021Introduction of EAS UpdatePost EAS LaunchIntroduction of EAS WorkflowsPost EAS LaunchDeprecation of expo eject (SDK 46)August 2022Phasing out of classic expo buildGradual post EASTable 2: Comparison of Build and Deployment Workflow: Before and After EASFeature/AspectBefore EASAfter EASBuilding Standalone Appsexpo build (cloud-based, less control)EAS Build (cloud-based, more control, custom native code support)Custom Native CodeRequired "ejecting" (loss of managed workflow)Supported without full eject via EAS Build and expo prebuildApp Store SubmissionManual process using platform-specific toolsStreamlined via eas submit commandInternal TestingLimited capabilities within Expo GoEnhanced with EAS Build development builds and internal distributionAutomationLimited built-in automationExtensive automation capabilities with EAS WorkflowsTransparencyLess insight into the build processMore transparency and control over the build processIn conclusion, the journey of Expo's build and deployment services reflects a continuous effort to simplify and enhance the mobile application development experience.
