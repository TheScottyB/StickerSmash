# EAS Deployment: CLI vs. Hub Approach Comparison

## Overview

This document provides a comparative analysis of two Expo Application Services (EAS) deployment approaches:
1. The CLI-based approach (attempted first)
2. The Hub/Workflows approach (current experiment)

Our research evaluates these approaches in the context of a React Native application (StickerSmash) developed with modern features including error boundaries, memory management, and robust permission handling.

## Key Comparison Points

### 1. Project Initialization

| Aspect | CLI Approach | Hub Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Process** | Command-line commands (`eas init`, `eas build:configure`) | Web dashboard UI with visual prompts |
| **Interactivity** | Requires interactive terminal | Can be done entirely through web interface |
| **Fails in our case?** | Yes - couldn't handle non-interactive environment | Potentially more successful (testing in progress) |
| **Historical Account Handling** | Poor - no visibility into account-specific issues | Better - UI can display relevant account context |

### 2. Configuration Management

| Aspect | CLI Approach | Hub Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Configuration Files** | Manual creation via templates | Templates available in dashboard |
| **Project ID Assignment** | Manual UUID not accepted | Automatically assigned through UI |
| **Credential Management** | Command-line prompts | Visual credential management |
| **Transparency** | Limited visibility into issues | More detailed error reporting |

### 3. Build Process

| Aspect | CLI Approach | Hub Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Command Structure** | `eas build --platform ios --profile development` | Visual workflow selection and execution |
| **Error Reporting** | Terminal output only | Visual logs with searchable history |
| **Build Monitoring** | Limited progress indicators | Live status updates and notifications |
| **Resource Selection** | Profile-based | Visual selection with resource estimations |

### 4. Automation Capabilities

| Aspect | CLI Approach | Hub Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **CI/CD Integration** | Requires external CI system | Built-in workflows |
| **Trigger Options** | Manual or via CI | Manual, schedule, Git events |
| **Workflow Definition** | Shell scripts or CI config | Declarative YAML in `eas-workflows.yml` |
| **Error Recovery** | Manual intervention | Configurable retry policies |
| **Notifications** | Requires external setup | Integrated notification options |

### 5. Submission Process

| Aspect | CLI Approach | Hub Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Process** | Command: `eas submit` | Part of workflow or manual trigger |
| **Credential Handling** | Manual entry each time | Stored in dashboard securely |
| **App Store Integration** | Basic | Enhanced with better error messages |
| **Versioning** | Manual increments | Automatic options available |

## Preliminary Findings

Our initial CLI-based approach encountered several blockers:
1. Inability to create projects in non-interactive environments
2. Problematic handling of accounts with historical configurations
3. Inflexible UUID handling that required backend project existence

However, the official Expo documentation suggests a simplified CLI workflow:
```bash
npx eas-cli@latest login
npx eas-cli@latest init
```

We're testing both approaches to determine:
1. If the simplified CLI workflow works in our environment with our historical account
2. If not, whether the Hub approach resolves these issues

The Hub-based approach potentially addresses CLI limitations through:
1. Visual project creation without terminal interactivity
2. Better visibility into account-specific configuration issues
3. Automated project ID assignment
4. Workflow-based automation that builds on successful configurations

## Research Implications

This comparison highlights a key evolution in iOS deployment tools:
1. **Historical Context Matters**: Accounts with 10+ years of history create unique deployment challenges
2. **Interactive vs. Visual**: The shift from command-line to visual interfaces changes the deployment experience
3. **Automation Depth**: Workflows enable deeper automation than standalone CLI commands
4. **Error Transparency**: Visual interfaces provide better context for understanding and resolving deployment issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Hub-based deployment test
2. Document specific advantages/disadvantages for accounts with historical configurations
3. Quantify the improvement (if any) in deployment success rate
4. Create guidance for teams choosing between approaches based on their specific contexts
