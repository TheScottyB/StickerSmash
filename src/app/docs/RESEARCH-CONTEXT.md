# iOS App Deployment Research Project

## Overview

This repository is part of a broader technical investigation comparing modern approaches to iOS app development and deployment. StickerSmash serves as the first experimental app in a series of four distinct applications, each testing different cutting-edge methods for creating and deploying iOS apps.

## Research Objectives

1. **Compare Deployment Methodologies**: Evaluate emerging tools and services that simplify traditionally complex aspects of iOS app submission
2. **Test New Apple Features**: Explore recent Apple platform capabilities and how they can be leveraged
3. **Measure Developer Experience**: Quantify time savings and complexity reduction in the app development lifecycle
4. **Identify Best Practices**: Determine optimal approaches for different types of applications

## Experiment Design

Each of the four applications represents a controlled experiment with:

| App | Focus Area | Primary Technology | Deployment Method |
|-----|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **StickerSmash** | Automated submission | Expo + EAS | EAS Auto-Submit |
| **App #2** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **App #3** | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **App #4** | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## StickerSmash Experiment: EAS Auto-Submit

### Hypothesis
Modern EAS auto-submit workflows can reduce iOS app submission complexity by >90% compared to traditional Xcode-based workflows.

### Method
1. Implement a complete photo sticker app using React Native and Expo
2. Configure deployment using EAS auto-submit capabilities
3. Track time, steps, and complexity metrics during the submission process
4. Compare results to historical data on traditional iOS deployment methods

### Success Criteria
- Complete iOS submission with minimal manual steps
- Zero Xcode interaction required
- App successfully reaches App Store
- Process can be fully documented in under one page of instructions

## Data Collection

For each app in the research series, we'll track:
- Total development time
- Deployment preparation time
- Number of manual steps required
- Error frequency and types
- Time to market
- App review duration

## Expected Outcomes

This research aims to establish a comparative framework for evaluating iOS deployment approaches, with a particular focus on identifying the most efficient and developer-friendly methods for bringing high-quality apps to market.

The findings will be valuable for:
- Mobile development teams seeking optimal workflows
- Technology decision-makers evaluating development platforms
- Individual developers looking to reduce submission friction

## Broader Context

This investigation represents an exploration of how Apple's ecosystem continues to evolve, particularly focusing on the democratization of app development and the reduction of traditional technical barriers to app publication.
