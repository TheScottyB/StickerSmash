# Technical Investigation Notes

## Project: iOS App Publishing Methodologies
## App 1: StickerSmash - EAS Approach

### Research Summary

StickerSmash serves as our first test case in exploring modern iOS app deployment methods. This app focuses specifically on the Expo/EAS workflow as a fully automated path to App Store publication.

### Key Technical Approaches Attempted

1. **EAS Auto-Submit Flow**
   - Command: `eas build --platform ios --profile production --auto-submit`
   - Promised workflow: Configuration-driven, zero Xcode interaction
   - Reality: Requires interactive setup that cannot be fully automated

2. **Expo Development Patterns**
   - File-based routing (Expo Router)
   - Permission management best practices
   - Memory management optimizations
   - Error boundary implementation

### Initial Findings

| Aspect | Documentation Claim | Actual Experience |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Setup Complexity | "One command setup" | Multiple interactive prompts that can't be avoided |
| Project Creation | Fully automated | Requires interactive terminal or web console |
| Certificate Management | "Zero manual cert management" | Not testable without project creation |
| Platform Requirements | Any OS | Any OS, but requires interactive terminal |

### Limitations Discovered

1. **Project Creation Roadblock**:
   - EAS requires interactive prompts for project initialization
   - Cannot create projects via pure automation or CI/CD
   - Manually generated project IDs are rejected by the API

2. **Documentation vs. Reality Gap**:
   - Documentation claims "one command" deployment
   - Actual experience requires multiple interactive steps
   - CLI flags for automation (like `--create-project`) don't exist

3. **Interactive Terminal Requirement**:
   - Commands like `eas init` and `eas build:configure` require stdin
   - No API or configuration file can replace these interactive steps
   - Makes true CI/CD integration challenging

### Potential Workarounds

1. **Two-Phase Deployment**:
   - Phase 1: Manual, interactive setup to create the EAS project
   - Phase 2: Automated builds using the established project ID
   - Limitation: Each new app still requires manual initialization

2. **Web Console Initialization**:
   - Create projects via the Expo web console
   - Extract project IDs and copy to app.json
   - Still requires human intervention for each new project

### Update to Comparison Metrics

| Metric | Traditional Approach | EAS Approach (Claimed) | EAS Approach (Actual) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Setup Steps | 15-20 | 3-5 | 8-10 (including manual steps) |
| Time to First Build | 2-3 hours | 15-30 minutes | 30-60 minutes |
| Certificate Management | Manual | Automatic | Automatic (after setup) |
| Platform Requirements | macOS only | Any OS | Any OS + interactive terminal |
| Reproducibility | Variable | Consistent | Consistent (after manual setup) |
| CI/CD Readiness | Complex | Simple | Requires manual preparation |

### Strategic Implications

The EAS approach does simplify iOS deployment compared to traditional methods, but the promise of fully automated "one command" deployment is not yet realized, especially for:

1. New projects requiring initialization
2. CI/CD systems without interactive terminals
3. Teams seeking zero-touch automation

### Next Steps for Research

1. Test app deployment using traditional Xcode + App Store Connect approach
2. Investigate alternative hybrid approaches (e.g., Fastlane + EAS)
3. Explore EAS Project REST API if available to bypass CLI limitations
4. Document a proper setup flow that acknowledges these limitations
